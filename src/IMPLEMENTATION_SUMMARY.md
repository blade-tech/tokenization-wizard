# Terminology System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive terminology simplification system for the ACP Tokenization DS application with a global toggle supporting 3 modes: Plain-English (default), Legal, and Dual.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Global Terminology Control
- **Default Mode**: Plain-English (user-friendly)
- **Toggle Location**: Header (top right), accessible from all screens
- **Modes**:
  - **Plain**: "Official Gate", "Atomic settlement", "Required key?"
  - **Legal**: "ACP", "DvP/PvP", "Necessary credential"
  - **Dual**: "Official Gate (ACP)", "Atomic settlement (DvP/PvP)"

### 2. Component Architecture
```
AppContext.tsx
├── terminologyMode: 'plain' | 'legal' | 'dual' (default: 'plain')
├── glossaryOpen: boolean
└── glossaryFilterTerm: string | null

TermComponents.tsx
├── Term (inline terms with tooltips/dialogs)
└── TermLabel (form field labels)

TerminologyControls.tsx
├── TerminologyToggle (3-state mode switcher)
├── GlossaryButton (opens full glossary)
└── GlossaryModal (searchable drawer)

terminology.tsx
└── GLOSSARY: 30+ term definitions with citations
```

### 3. Visual Affordances

#### Book Icons
- 12-14px BookOpen icons next to all glossary terms
- Clicking opens GlossaryDrawer filtered to that specific term
- Color: `var(--accent-primary)` for visibility

#### Tooltips (Desktop)
- Min-width: 280px, Max-width: 360px
- Shows alternate terminology (Legal when in Plain mode, vice versa)
- Definition text with line-height 1.4
- Citations section with legal references
- "Learn more in glossary →" link (accent color, underlined)
- WCAG AA contrast compliant

#### Mobile Dialogs (< 768px)
- Touch-friendly expandable sheets instead of tooltips
- Full term information with scrollable content
- "View full glossary →" button
- Prevents accidental dismissal

### 4. Copy Updates

#### Before → After

| Inputs | Intended ACP Binding Path | Intended Official Gate | Intended Official Gate (ACP) |
| Show Work | Step D: ACP Test | Step D: Tokenization Test | Tokenization Test |
| Show Work | Necessary? | Required key? | Required key? (Necessary credential) |
| Show Work | Sufficient? | Auto-execute? | Auto-execute? (Sufficient instruction) |

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
// AppContext.tsx
const [terminologyMode, setTerminologyMode] = useState<TerminologyMode>('plain');
const [glossaryOpen, setGlossaryOpen] = useState(false);
const [glossaryFilterTerm, setGlossaryFilterTerm] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

### Term Component Usage
```tsx
// Inline term with tooltip
<Term termKey="official-gate">Official Gate</Term>

// Form label with helper icon
<TermLabel termKey="official-gate" required helperText="Where ownership is recorded" />

// Get display value programmatically
{getDisplayValue("registry-of-record", terminologyMode)}
```

### Mobile Detection
```typescript
function useIsMobile() {
  const [isMobile, setIsMobile] = useState(false);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const checkMobile = () => setIsMobile(window.innerWidth < 768);
    checkMobile();
    window.addEventListener('resize', checkMobile);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', checkMobile);
  }, []);
  
  return isMobile;
}
```

5. **Controllable Electronic Record**: "A digital record you can control like possession, with take-free protection for good-faith buyers."
6. **Electronic Transferable Record**: "An electronic stand-in for paper title/IOUs, made legally effective by 'control'."

## Conclusion

The terminology system successfully transforms the ACP Tokenization DS from a legal/technical tool into an accessible application that serves both expert and non-expert users. The Plain-English default lowers the barrier to entry while maintaining full access to precise legal terminology when needed. The comprehensive glossary with contextual access ensures users can learn domain concepts without leaving their workflow.

**Legal rigor is never compromised—it's made accessible** through multiple discovery mechanisms (tooltips, dialogs, glossary, Dual mode) and full exportability in PDF reports with terminology mappings and legal citations.

**Status**: ✅ Complete and ready for production
